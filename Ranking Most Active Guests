Problem:

Rank guests based on the number of messages they've exchanged with the hosts. 
Guests with the same number of messages as other guests should have the same rank. Do not skip rankings if the preceding rankings are identical.
Output the rank, guest id, and number of total messages they've sent. Order by the highest number of total messages first.

Table: airbnb_contacts

id_guest: varchar
id_host: varchar
id_listing: varchar
ts_contact_at: datetime
ts_reply_at: datetime
ts_accepted_at: datetime
ts_booking_at: datetime
ds_checkin: datetime
ds_checkout: datetime
n_guests: int
n_messages: int

Solution:

with cte as(
  select id_guest,
         sum(n_messages) as n_messages_sum,
         dense_rank() over (order by sum(n_messages) desc) as rnk
  from airbnb_contacts
  group by id_guest)
select id_guest, n_messages_sum, rnk
from cte
order by n_messages_sum desc
