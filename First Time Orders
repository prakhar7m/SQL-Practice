Problem: 

For each merchant, find how many orders and first-time orders they had. 
First-time orders are meant from the perspective of a customer and are the first order that a customer ever made.
In order words, for how many customers was this the first-ever merchant they ordered with?
Output the name of the merchant, the total number of their orders and the number of these orders that were first-time orders.

Table: doordash_orders

id: int
customer_id: int
merchant_id: int
order_timestamp: datetime
n_items: int
total_amount_earned: float

Table: doordash_merchants

id: int
name: varchar
category: varchar
zipcode: int

Solution 

with first_order as(
  select customer_id,
         first_value(merchant_id) over(partition by customer_id order by order_timestamp) as first_merchant
         from doordash_orders),
     
     number_of_customers as(
  select merchant_id,
         count(distinct f.customer_id) as first_time_orders,
         count(distinct id) as n_orders
  from doordash_orders d
  left join first_order f on d.merchant_id = f.first_merchant 
  group by 1)
  
 select name, first_time_orders, n_orders 
 from number_of_customers
 join doordash_merchants on number_of_customers.merchant_id=doordash_merchants.id
