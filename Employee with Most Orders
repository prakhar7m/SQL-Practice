Problem: 

What is the last name of the employee or employees who are responsible for the most orders?

Table: shopify_orders

order_id: int
shop_id: int
user_id: int

payment_method: varchar
created_at: datetime
resp_employee_id: int

Table: shopify_employees

Solution: 

with cte as 
  (select id,
          last_name,
          count(*) as n_orders,
          rank() over(order by count(*) desc) as rnk
   from shopify_orders
   join shopify_employees
   on resp_employee_id = id
   group by id, last_name)
select last_name
from cte
where rnk = 1
