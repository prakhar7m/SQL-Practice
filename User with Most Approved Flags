Problem:

Which user flagged the most distinct videos that ended up approved by YouTube? 
Output, in one column, their full name or names in case of a tie. In the user's full name, include a space between the first and the last name.

Table: user_flags

user_firstname: varchar
user_lastname: varchar
video_id: varchar
flag_id: varchar

Table: flag_review

flag_id: varchar
reviewed_by_yt: bool
reviewed_date: datetime
reviewed_outcome: varchar

Solution:

select username

from (
  select concat(user_firstname, ' ' , user_lastname) as username,
         dense_rank() over(order by count(distinct video_id) desc) as rnk
    from user_flags as uf
    inner join flag_review as fr
    on uf.flag_id = fr.flag_id
    where lower(fr.reviewed_outcome) = 'approved'
    group by username) as subquery
  
where rnk = 1
