Problem:

Given a phone log table that has information about callers' call history, find out the callers whose first and last calls were to the same person on a given day.
Output the caller ID, recipient ID, and the date called.

Table: caller_history

caller_id: int
recipient_id: int
date_called: datetime

Solution:

with first_and_last as
  (select *,
          first_value(recipient_id) over (partition by caller_id, DATE(date_called) order by date_called asc) as first_call,
          first_value(recipient_id) over( partition by caller_id, DATE(date_called) order by date_called desc) as last_call
   from caller_history)
select distinct caller_id, first_call as recipient_id, DATE(date_called)
from first_and_last
where first_call = last_call
